<h3 align="center">Learning-based models for Classification</h3>

## What we have built?
We have built multiple learning based models for Classification on Sequential data (ECG) to detect the probability of heart disease. Ensemble Learning, Support Vector Machines, Bernoulli Nave Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, and the Random Forest Classifier are explored in great depth for our classification task
